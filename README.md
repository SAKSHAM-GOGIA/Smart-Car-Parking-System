# Smart-Car-Parking-System 
This project aims to build smart parking system for a corporate environment. The parking system can be subdivided into 2 parts, general parking and reserve parking which will include the use of an RFID sensor. IR sensors have been used to look for open parking spaces. The system would utilize MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for transmission of the message from the IR sensor to the MQTT broker (Adafruit IO).
